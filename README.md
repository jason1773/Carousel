## Carousel

The purpose of this homework is to use Xcode to implement the flow between the screens of an application. 
Time spent: `7`

### Features
Sign in with alert errors, tutorial flow, scrollable settings and conversations. 

#### Required
I did all required sections

#### Optional
NONE, sorry.

#### The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Push vs modal segue uses
2. dot pagination

### Video Walkthrough

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. 
I had functions in the wrong place in the swift files, I think the homework code snips need to have more context around WHERE to put them.
